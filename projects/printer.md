I designed and built a large format 3D printer based on one of the classic [Prusa i3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prusa_i3) designs. The basic 8" x 8" x 8" frame was extended to be a larger 24" x 24" x 24" format. I opted for a RAMPS 1.4 board and was running [Marlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlin_(firmware) firmware. 

The primary motivation behind extending to this larger format was to experiment with propmaking new decorative props for the [Krewe of Bacchus Parade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krewe_of_Bacchus). In high school, I spend many weekends helping with installing electronics and lighting on several of the krewe's floats, and I envisioned this printer helping make more complex and eye-catching pieces.

I documented the final build process in a video:
